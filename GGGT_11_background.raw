<p>Granny's Great Grandma's Tiara was written during the spring of 2012 as an experiment in doing a high-quality larp with minimal effort. We wrote the original version of the larp during two evening sessions and then set up a double-run during a single day in an apartment kitchen. The total effort to design and run this larp came in at around 24 hours of total work split between the two of us.</p>

<p>It was originally written in Swedish under the name "Mormors Mormors Mammas Tiara". Since that original double-run, it has been arranged in several other locations, including Prolog and Stockholm Scenario Festival. There have also been runs outside of Sweden which prompted the translation to English.</p>

<p>We have written a companion larp written called "The Ancestral Farm" about the equivalent male traditional concerns of inheritance and duty. That larp has yet to be translated to English.</p>
