<h3 class="newpage" id="daughter_f">Daughter F</h3>

<p>You were born in 2003 in this rental apartment in Södermalm in downtown Stockholm and you are now 17 years old. Your father left you and your mother when you were seven to move back to Australia and you never forgave him for that.</p>

<p>You do not have any particular interest in your father's family background, but you do feel all the more strongly about your connection to your ancestresses and their fantastic legacy. You are fascinated by the past and want to study history or archaeology at university.</p>

<p>At some point in the future, when you get married, you will inherit the Tiara as the next in line of your family. The Tiara came to Sweden with your granny's great grandma, a German noblewoman. As a school project, you have done research into the women of your family five generations back. Your ancestress, the Viscountess of Holstein-Kiel, whose entire family was killed by a mob during a food riot in 1872, fled all by herself through Europe and had many adventures in both Paris and Milano. She finally arrived in Stockholm where a rich industry magnate fell head over heels in love with her and they had a magnificent fairytale wedding — with the Tiara glittering on the head of the Viscountess. The Tiara is an important symbol of your background and of your identity.</p>

<p>You want a strong connection to your ancestresses and the strongest connection you have is the idea that you will one day get married wearing the family Tiara.</p>

<p>Feel free to improvise anecdotes about past events you have uncovered when studying your family history, including adventures the Viscountess had while traveling Europe. She escaped in a hay wagon! She was rescued by the Crown Prince, later Emperor, Franz Joseph of Austria who fell madly in love with her and would have given up his throne for her, had she only wanted him! Elaborate freely as these are all rumours you picked up and stories you have found in old diaries.</p>

<h4>Player instructions</h4>

<p>You start Act 5: Resolution / The day after after all have sat down at the table. When everything seems to be in order, you start the act by simply saying anything that comes to your character's mind.</p>

<h4>Voluntary accessory</h4>
<p>A novel. Preferably an old classic.</p>

<h3 class="newpage" id="mother_e">Mother E</h3>

<p>You were born in a simple apartment in Södermalm in downtown Stockholm in 1967 and you are 53 years old. You have a practical mind and like getting things done. After culinary school, you started a catering business that you have run since then. It has slowly grown, and you now have a solid network of chefs and can take on rather large events. Unfortunately, profitability is a bit of a challenge so you make ends meet, but not a lot more. The job means long hours and late evenings, but you are proud of what you have achieved. Your only concern is that you have not been able to give your daughter the financial security you would have wanted.</p>

<p>Your were married for a few years to your daughter's father, a charming Australian bartender, before you split up and he moved back to his native country. You do not actively dislike each other, but you have very little contact these days. Your daughter has not wanted to meet him after he left, so it simply hasn't happened that they have met since then.</p>

<p>There are two things you would like to do for your daughter. One is to travel a month or two around Australia so that she can reconnect with her Australian heritage. The other is that you would like to give her enough money for a down payment on an apartment when she will need one in a few years. These are things you have heard that other parents do for their children but it has simply not been possible for you.</p>

<p>When you got married, you inherited the fantastic family heirloom, the Tiara. The idea is that your daughter will get it when she gets married, but in your opinion this is a rather stale family tradition. You have thought about this for many years and have now made up your mind. You will sell the Tiara. You have been in touch with an auction firm that has valued the Tiara to 250 000 SEK which would cover both a trip to Australia and a down payment for a small city apartment.</p>

<p>The auction firm will call you tomorrow to confirm the sale. But you want to inform your daughter and your mother in person about the decision before you make that call. You are not sure what kind of reaction you will get. You know deep down that this is the right thing to do and it is important that they understand why.</p>

<h4>Player instructions</p>

<h5>Act 1: Relationship Building</h5>

<p>You will finish Act 1 by saying, after about 20 minutes, “I have decided to sell the Tiara”.</p>

<p>Other characters will probably catch their breath and want to speak, but they may not. Raise a fist above your head and say: “Cut". We now enter Act 2. We shall now, one by one, hold a short monologue about our characters' feelings.”</p>

<h5>Act 2: Monologues</h5>

<p>Let your character hold a monologue, no longer than 60 seconds, about her thoughts on the matter of the Tiara. When you are done, nod to another player who can take over. When all have had their turn and all are sitting down, raise your fist again and say: “Act 3: Conflict, starts now and continues for 20 minutes.”</p>

<p>Lower your fist and repeat your last line: “I have decided to sell the Tiara.”</p>

<h5>Act 4: The Dream Sequences</h5>

<p>Act 4 ends with the Viscountess A <span class="italics">(ghost)</span> telling everyone to put back the chairs and tables. While others do this, set an alarm on your cell phone so that it will ring 20 minutes after the start of Act 5: The day after / Resolution.</p>

<h5>Act 5: The Day After / Resolution</h5>

<p>Act 5 and the entire game will end when your cell phone rings. It is the auction house calling to get the final OK to sell the Tiara. Clearly tell them your decision. When the call is over, you will raise a fist above your head and say that the game is over.</p>

<h4>Voluntary accessory</h4>

<p>A cell phone that rings occasionally. You do not answer except at the end of Act 5.</p>

<h3 class="newpage" id="granny_d">Granny D</h3>

<p>You were born in 1933 in a middle class apartment in Vasastan in downtown Stockholm and you are 87 years old. You grew up in the shadow of a principled matriarch of a mother and never required much space or attention. You want people to agree and like each other, and you dislike conflict of all kinds.</p>

<p>Only once in your life did you ever stand up to your mother and that was the day you applied to a teachers college to start your own career. Your grandmother B, in whose large country house you spent many fantastic summers, helped you finance your studies. You became a teacher and thereby the first woman of your family with her own professional income. You later married a fellow teacher from the school in Södermalm in downtown Stockholm where you worked. He passed away a few years ago.</p>

<p>Regarding the Tiara, you don’t have any particularly strong feelings for it. You wore it when you got married, but you couldn't really find much other use for a large and sparkling piece of diamond jewelry. You do, however, know how much it meant to your mother.</p>

<p>In your life, what matters most is the happiness of your daughter E and your granddaughter F.</p>

<p>Your secret wish is to free yourself from your mother, whose opinions and (non-)approval have always loomed over you.</p>

<h4>Player instructions</h4>

<p>You will finish Act 3: Conflict. This is the act that starts with Mother E repeating her line “I have decided to sell the Tiara”. End the act by pretending to receive a message/call on your old cell phone saying your pre-booked taxi has arrived. You end the act by saying good by and leaving the apartment. Wait a second and then walk back into the room with your fist raised above your head, saying “This ends Act 3. Act 4 consists of 3 dream sequences. We move away the table and chairs to get an open space and then we give the scene to Great Grandma C”.</p>

<h4>Voluntary Accessory</h4>

<p>A candy box to offer from when brokering peace.</p>

<h3 class="newpage" id="Great Grandma_c">Great Grandma C <span class="italics">(ghost)</span></h3>

<p>You were born in 1902 in Gnesta, a small village on the countryside far outside of Stockholm. You childhood was simple but comfortable in a spacious but unassuming house filled with the smell of freshly baked cinnamon rolls. But your family legacy promised you so much more.</p>

<p>You are the descendent of a fantastic family line, whose history was filled with both adventure and glamour. Never was this more pronounced than in the life of your grandmother, the Viscountess A, whom you always looked up to. Losing her when you were just a teenager was a hard blow. Some years later when your childhood home burned down to the ground in a fire, almost everything that connected you to your family history and financial security was destroyed. The only remnant was the Tiara, which you inherited when you got married. The Tiara was your most prized possession and your only connection with your ancestresses. You have never even considered the idea that it could ever be sold.</p>

<p>You married a bank clerk when you were young and moved back with him to Vasastan in downtown Stockholm, fleeing the suffocating country life and ruling your new household with an iron fist. You value a conservative, but active, lifestyle. You participated in several charities dealing with moral questions (which?). You arranged meetings and sewing bees in your apartment. You coordinated cultural outings to the theatre. You did not care much for the fight for the right to vote, which was in full swing during your teenage years. You have tried to lead your daughter with a firm hand and make her understand her feminine heritage and duty, and the value of the old housewife ideals. If women try to be like men, they lose their feminine power and greatness. You try to balance the disappointment you felt when your daughter went against you and entered a teachers collage with a secret admiration (so far never spoken out loud to living or dead) that she actually did it…</p>

<p>You do not want your descendants to lose their link back to their ancestresses and the Tiara is the last and foremost remaining symbol of the family legacy.</p>

<p>Despite your differences, you have a mostly positive relationship with your mother B. But you do think that her decision to go around you to financially support your daughter's collage tuition was equal parts helping her and sticking it to you and you have never (yet) said your piece to her about that betrayal.</p>

<p>You never understood your mother B's bitterness to her mother, the Viscountess A, and the fantastic life that A gave her. You sometimes get angry with B that she does not appreciate A.</p>

<p>You will not tell anyone about your grief over the house fire, and what truly happened there, until you hold a dream sequence with Mother E in Act 3 where you will visualise/tell exactly what happened and how you felt about it. During the dream sequence you will communicate how important you consider continuity and family to be and how disappointed you would be if she were to get rid of the last family heirloom.</p>

<h4>Player instructions</h4>

<p>You start Act 4: The dream sequences when Granny D's player, with her fist raised above their head, tells you to do this.</p>

<p>You will have the first dream sequence together with Mother E. It may take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes. Bring her to the middle of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story. Explain what really happened during the house fire and how it affected you. You control the game world completely and everything you say becomes reality. Borrow other players as extras if you wish, but you will not have time to give them particularly detailed instructions.</p>

<p>End the scene by saying “I now leave your dream. Come with me” and take Mother by the hand to the edge of the room.</p>

<p>A fine brooch</p>

<h3 class="newpage" id="grannys_granny_b">Granny's Granny B <span class="italics">(ghost)</span></h3>

<p>You were born in a grand apartment in central Stockholm in 1880. You grew up surrounded by nannies, governesses and girl schools. What you lacked in your childhood was a mother who was present. No matter how hard you tried to get close to her, she always kept her distance. Your clearest memory of her, the Viscountess A, was of her sitting at her dressing table getting ready to go out to yet another party. Next to her was always the great Tiara, the last remnant of her life in the German nobility. As such, it always represented everything wrong with your childhood.</p>

<p>As an adult you found a good man, the postmaster of Gnesta, and you moved as far from the city as you could. There you raised your daughter with baking and crafts and all the love you never got. But she was a stubborn one and it was clear from an early age that she idolised her grandmother, the Viscountess A, and the fast life in the city. As soon as she was grown, she married a city man and moved back to that life.</p>

<p>Your beloved granddaughter D was with you most summers and when your daughter was not prepared to help out financially, you pitched in and gave D the money for tuition for teachers' college.</p>

<p>You do not think your mother could have missed how disappointed you were with her, but even so she she was always too self-centred and has never apologised (she should!).  But even so, you feel a respect for her deep down, for reasons you have never told anyone, living or dead.</p>

<p>Regarding the Tiara, you think it might as well be sold off and the money invested into something useful. It is a bad symbol of decadence. You inherited it when you got married, but then let it rest in a bank vault and never touched it. Today, you regret not selling it yourself when you had the chance. Instead you followed the family tradition and handed it to your daughter on her wedding day.</p>

<p>In the dream sequence with your granddaughter D in Act 4 you will finally let everything out and tell her in detail what sort of person Grannys's Great Grandma the Viscountess A really was!</p>

<h3>Player instructions</h3>

<p>In Act 4: The Dream Sequence you will have the second dream sequence together with your granddaughter, Granny D. It may take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes. Bring her to the center of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story. Tell her all the details of what kind of person your mother really was. You control the game world completely and everything you say becomes reality. Borrow other players as extras if you wish, but you will not have time to give them particularly detailed instructions.</p>

<p>End the scene by saying “I now leave your dream. Come with me” and take Granny D by the hand to the edge of the room.</p>

<h4>Voluntary accessory</h4>

<p>A kitchen implement.</p>

<h3 class="newpage" id="grannys_greatgrandmother_a">Granny's Great Grandma, Viscountess A <span class="italics">(ghost)</span></h3>

<p>You were born into a poor farmer’s family in Småland on the Swedish countryside in 1853, but you always had an appetite for the good things in life. When your brother got the opportunity to go down to the shipyard in Lübeck in Germany and work there, you followed him to get a chance to see the world.</p>

<p>Once in Lübeck, you managed to get a job in the kitchen of a lesser noble family, which was not quite the glamour you were looking for. With some charm and one or two somewhat less than moral acts, you managed to rise to the position of chambermaid which was more to your taste.</p>

<p>Because of local unrest, the family you worked for had do depart to America on short notice. You stayed behind to pack up the last of their possessions. But rather than accompany the luggage across the ocean you put a sum of money, some jewels, and a fantastic Tiara in your pocket and disappeared.</p>

<p>Back in Stockholm, you introduced yourself under a new name and title. With the money you had, and the Tiara more specifically, you were quickly accepted into society. Everyone in Stockholm, including your children and grand-children, think you are a Viscountess from Holstein-Kiel whose entire family was murdered by a mob in the food riot of 1872. You made up stories about how you fled through many adventures in both Paris and Milano before finally arriving in Stockholm and settling there.</p>

<p>An industrial magnate of humble origins but with with massive resources fell for you and a fairy-tale wedding later you had the life you always dreamed of. Parties, social functions and no more scrubbing floors.</p>

<p>Together you had a daughter and a son, and you made sure that they were given a first-rate upbringing with nannies and good schools, all of which you could not even dream of as a child. You know that your daughter is angry with you for being what she considers an absent mother, but she cannot even imagine how good she had it - you love her, so why can't she be more grateful to you? Your motto has always been "Carpe Diem" and you are a bit sad that your daughter did not adopt the same perspective on life. Your granddaughter, however, showed more grit but unfortunately you did not live long enough to see her become a grown woman.</p>

<p>Concerning the Tiara, it was very practical and a means to achieve your dreams, but you have always been a pragmatic person. You sometimes find that your descendents are just a bit too sentimental and focus way too much on family history rather than getting to where they want in life.</p>

<p>You will not tell anyone your true story or how you came by the Tiara until you are doing your dream sequence with your great great grand-daughter F. In it you will show/tell in monologue form your entire story with all of the details.</p>

<h4>Player instructions</h4>

<p>In Act 4: The Dream Sequences you will have the third and last dream sequence together with Daughter F. It may take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes. Bring her to the center of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story. Tell your daughter the truth about who you really are. You control the game world completely and everything you say becomes reality. Borrow other players as extras if you wish, but you will not have time to give them particularly detailed instructions.</p>

<p>End the scene by saying “I now leave your dream. Come with me” and take Daughter F by the hand to the edge of the room. As it is the last of the dream sequences, once it is over, raise a fist above your hand and say "Now we move on to Act 5: The day after. We put back the table and chairs and start the scene as soon as Daughter F begins to act."</p>

<h4>Voluntary Accessory</h4>

<p>An envelope symbolising an important letter you never actually wrote. Perhaps a letter to your parents, or maybe your older brother? Or one telling your daughter the full truth?</p>
