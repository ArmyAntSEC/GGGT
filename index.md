A tale of six generations of women by Susanne Vejdemo (susanne@vejdemo.se) and Daniel Armyr (daniel@armyr.se)

Granny’s Great Grandma’s Tiara is a low-key nordic larp about Swedish femininity, traditionally female concerns and the relationships between mothers and daughters. It involves six generations of women from the same family, three living and three dead, deciding the fate of their greatest family heirloom. The larp takes place in Stockholm in the year 2020.

A single production of the larp takes about 3.5 hours, including preparation and post-larp reflections. It requires exactly six players and an optional game master and works well for beginners.

 - _Do you mean that your Granny's Great Grandma's past is more important that your future?_
 - _No. I mean that my Granny's Great Grandma's past is a part of my future!_

Quote from the original 2012 production.
