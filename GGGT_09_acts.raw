<p>The larp is played as a sequence of shorter acts. Each act has a clear starting point, theme, and a clear signal when it ends. For each act, there is a section called "Game master Instructions". These are for games that have a game master. For games without a game master, these instructions are repeated in the character descriptions for the respective character who is responsible for starting/ending a given act.</p>

<h3>Starting the game</h3>

<p>To start the game, everyone should decide what their first action is going to be and then stand in an action pose as if they were just about to start that action. One player, or the game master, says "The game begins" and everyone performs that very first action they had planned.</p>

<h3>Act 1: Relationship building</h3>

<p><strong>20 minutes. Find your character. Find your relations. Ended by Mother E.</strong></p>

<p>In this act the players should become comfortable with their characters and their character's relationships with all of the other characters. No significant development of the characters or their relationships shall happen in this act. It is OK to make small changes to how you view your character or her relationships during this act. The goal is that you at the end of the act have a clear picture of who your character is and your starting relationships. This is also a time for the ghosts to get the hang of how they can interact with each other and the living characters in a constructive way.</p>

<p>During this act, the characters will prepare the last of the food. Towards the end of the act all will take their seats around the table and start eating. Once everyone has started eating, Mother E will reveal that she intends to sell the Tiara. As soon as she has said this, and before anyone else can say anything, the act will end.</p>

<h4>Game master Instructions</h4>

<p>Remind Mother E that she is to make sure all are properly served and seated after about 20 minutes and then end the act by saying “I have decided to sell the Tiara”.</p>

<p>Other characters will probably catch their breath and want to speak, but they may not. Raise a fist above your head and say: "Cut. We now go in to Act 2. We shall now, one by one, have a short monologue about what our characters feel.”</p>

<h3>Act 2: Monologues</h3>

<p><strong>5-10 minutes. What does your character really feel? Started by Mother E and ended when all have spoken.</strong></p>

<p>This mini-act starts directly after Mother E has informed the others that she plans to sell the Tiara. One at the time, in any order, the players do an internal monologue about how their character feels at this exact moment about the decision to sell the tiara. An internal monologue means that the player lets their character speak completely from the heart, as if no-one was listening. However, do not reveal any story-altering secrets at this time. No other characters are allowed to comment or react to what is said. Once everyone has had their turn, there is a short pause in silence where any who may have stood up are given time to sit down. Then Act 3: Conflict begins.</p>

<h4>Game master Instructions</h4>

<p>Inform the players that they shall each in turn do a monologue (no longer than 60 seconds) about their thoughts on the matter of the Tiara. When all have had their turn and all are sitting down, raise your fist again and say: “Act 3: Conflict, starts now and continues for 20 minutes. Mother E, please repeat your last line.”</p>

<h3>Act 3: Conflict</h3>

<p><strong>30 minutes. Clarify the conflict lines between characters. The act is started by Mother E and ended by Granny D.</strong></p>

<p>In this act, each character pushes their agenda and listens to the opinions of others. It is OK for your character to slightly change their view on any given topic, but no disagreements should be resolved in this act.</p>

<p>The act begins with a jump back in time. Mother E once more announces that she has decided to sell the Tiara. After this, all characters are free to act as they wish. However, no one may leave the table until each character, ghosts included, has had the chance to speak up. </p>

<p>After about 30 minutes, Granny D's pre-booked taxi will call and announce that they are waiting outside. At this time, Granny D will say goodbye and leave the apartment ending the act. Both Daughter F and Mother E can also end the act early by leaving the apartment.</p>

<h4>Game master Instructions</h4>

<p>Finish the act by nudging Granny D that she has received a message/call from the booked taxi that is now waiting outside. Once Granny D has left the apartment, raise your fist and say “This ends Act 3. Act 4 consists of 3 dream sequences. We move away the table and chairs to get an open space and then we give the scene to Granny’s Granny C”.</p>

<h3>Act 4: Dream sequence</h3>

<p><strong>10-30 minutes. Takes place during the night between day one and day two. In this act, and this act only, the ghosts are completely free to do whatever they want. Started by Great Grandma C <span class="italics">(ghost)</span> and ended by Viscountess A <span class="italics">(ghost)</span>.</strong></p>

<p>This act has three short scenes, one per ghost. Before the first scene, all will participate to clear an area where the dream sequences can be played out. Ahead of each scene, the responsible ghost player gets a minute to gather their thoughts and talk to any extras they wish to recruit. They then lead their assigned living character to the center of the room, explain the premise of the scene and start it.</p>

<h4>Game master Instructions</h4>

<p>When the last dream sequence is complete, tell the players to put the table and chairs back and to sit down. Start the act once everything is in order. Inform Daughter F that she should start the act by saying whatever is on her character's mind.</p>

<h3>Act 5: Resolution / The Day After</h3>

<p><strong>20 minutes. Granny D is invited back for mid-morning "fika". This act resolves (amicable or not) the conflicts from previous acts. Started by Daughter F and ended by Mother E.</strong></p>

<p>The last act takes place on the following day. All, both living and dead, have gathered for a mid-morning "fika". During this act, the characters try to find a resolution to their relationships and conflicts with the other characters, both living and dead. This resolution can be either positive (meaning the characters find common ground and understanding) or negative (meaning both characters clearly express that there can never be any common ground). In this act, it can make sense for living characters to address their dead relatives directly ("Oh, Granny, if you could hear me now, I'd tell you..."), but unfortunately the living still have a hard time hearing any responses from the dead.</p>

<p>The scene, and the game, ends with Mother E being called on her phone by the auction house asking about her final decision regarding the Tiara. Alternatively, Mother E calls the auction firm to inform them about her decision. During this phone call, all other characters must listen in silence. When Mother E hangs up, the game has ended.</p>

<h4>Game master Instructions</h4>

<p>After about 20 minutes, or when you feel the act has come to a natural end, make a phone call to the cell phone of Mother E and ask her for a decision on the Tiara. As soon as you get the Yes/No, hang up. Immediately, raise your fist and say "This ends the act and the game. Thank you all for playing!" After this, everyone stops playing their characters.</p>

<h3>Post-game reflections</h3>

<p><strong>20-40 minutes. Players share their experiences during the larp and settle back into their normal selves.</strong></p>

<p>When Act 5 has ended, leave a few minutes for free and spontaneous reflections and reactions from all players of the game. Then gather the players two-and-two, if possible pairing up players that have interacted less during the game. Each player tells the other player how they experienced the game.</p>

<p>Then, gather everyone present in a circle, and allow each person to tell the larger group about their thoughts and their experiences. It is encouraged to comment on fun and interesting things other players did during the game that improved your experience. Respect your fellow participants by only asking short clarifying questions and not starting any discussions until everyone has had their turn.</p>
