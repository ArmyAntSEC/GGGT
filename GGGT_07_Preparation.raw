<h3>Players needed</h3>

<p>This larp requires exactly six players. There are only female characters, but the larp deals more with traditional feminine concerns and less about female expression. As such, the larp works well regardless of the gender of the players.</p>

<p>The larp works well for beginners. If you have any players who are more experienced, it can make sense to assign them to the ghost roles.</p>

<p>The larp does not strictly require a separate game master. However, no one who plays a character should read any character descriptions except their own, complicating the preparations a bit. This is a larp where secrets play a significant role.</p>

<p>If there is a separate game master, this person is responsible for the pacing and handles the act breaks described on the character sheets. See the game master appendix for a summary of what the game master should keep track of during the game if one is present.</p>

<h3>Preparations before the event</h3>

<p>Review the list below to make sure all is prepared.</p>

<ul>
<li>A location. An open kitchen in an apartment is recommended but not required. You will need a table with exactly three chairs, and at least three other seats close to the table. A clearly visible wall clock also simplifies the game.</li>
<li>Prepare six name tags â€“ to keep it simple, consider using index cards and safety pins.</li>
<li>Print out the <a href="#characters" class="xref">character descriptions</a> and the smaller character notes (Available as a separate document).</li>
<li>Prepare some form of manual and timeless task that the women can work together on. The descriptions below assumes they will prepare something simple to eat, for example a fruit salad. Make sure there is enough for the ghosts as well, including the coffee/tea below.</li>
<li>Prepare "Fika" as well which will be needed for Act 5: The day after / Resolution.</li>
<li>Ensure that the player playing Mother E has a working cell phone. Unless there is a clearly visible wall clock in the space you are playing, make sure all characters have watches or some other way to check the time.</li>
<li>Those playing ghosts should be dressed in as much black as possible. Those not playing ghosts shall preferably be dressed in colors other than black. This is not crucial to the larp, however.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voluntary preparations</h3>

<p>Arrange a symbolic item for each of the characters. Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Granny's Great Grandma, The Viscountess A <span class="italics">(ghost)</span>:</strong> An envelope symbolising a letter she never wrote.</li>
<li> <strong>Granny's Granny B <span class="italics">(ghost)</span>:</strong> A kitchen implement.</li>
<li> <strong>Great Grandma C <span class="italics">(ghost)</span>:</strong> A fine brooch.</li>
<li> <strong>Granny D:</strong> A candy box to offer from when she wants to broker peace.</li>
<li> <strong>Mother E:</strong> The above mentioned cell phone.</li>
<li> <strong>Daughter F:</strong> A novel, preferably an old classic.</li>
</ul>
