# Preparation

Granny’s Great-granny’s Tiara is a low-key nordic larp[^1] about Swedish[^2] femininity, traditionally female concerns and the relationships between mothers and daughters. It takes place in-between six generations of women of the same family, three living and three ghosts. The larp takes place in Stockholm of 2012.

This larp uses the “ghost” meta technique in a very literal form. Unlike many other larps these ghosts have both personality and their own agendas and will try to use whatever influence they may have on their descendents.

A single production of the larp takes about 3.5 hours, including preparation and post-larp reflections.

[^1]: "What sets the Nordic larp traditions apart from others is a strong emphasis on collaboration and collective creation, unobtrusive rules, as well as a rich variety of play styles and settings sometimes including heavy themes." https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Nordic_larp

[^2]: None of the players familiar with Swedish culture? Not a problem. Just approximate with generalized western culture and go with it. Any specifics that matter to the game will be spelled out in the footnotes of this document.

## Players needed

The larp requires exactly six players. There are only female characters, but the larp deals more with traditional feminine concerns and less about female expression and as such the larp works well regardless of the gender of the players.

The larp works well for beginners. It can make sense to assign any more experienced players to the ghost roles.

The larp does not strictly require a separate game master. However, no one who plays a character may have read any character descriptions except their own. This is a lap where secrets have a role to play.

If there is a separate game master, this person should handle the act breaks described on the character sheets.

## Preparations before the event

Review the list below to make sure all is prepared.

* Arrange a location. An open kitchen is recommended but not required. You will need a table with exactly three chairs, and at least three other seats close to the table.
* Prepare six name tags – for example by using index cards and safety pins.
* Print out the character descriptions and the smaller character notes.
* Prepare something manual and timeless that the women can work together on.The descriptions below assume that they will prepare something simple to eat, for example a fruit salad.
* Prepare coffee/tea and biscuits as well. Make sure there is enough for the ghosts as well, including the food above.
* Ensure that the character playing Mother E has a working cell phone. Unless there is a clearly visible wall-clock in the space you are playing, make sure all characters have watches or some other way to check the time.
* Those playing ghosts shall preferably be dressed in as much black as possible. Those not playing ghosts shall preferably be dressed in colors other than black.

## Voluntary preparations

Arrange an item for each of the characters. Some suggestions: 

* Granny's Great-granny, The Viscountess A: An envelope symbolising a letter she never wrote.
* Granny's Granny B: A kitchen implement
* Great-granny C: A fine broach
* Granny D: A pastille box she can offer from when she wants to broker peace.
* Mother E: The above mentioned cell phone.
* Daughter F: A book, possibly an old classic.

# On location

## Warmup

When everyone is gathered and all preparations are done, it is time for a warmup to get the creativity going. 

One suggestion is provided below:

### The Coat Hanger

The point of this game is to warm up the creative part of the brain and get into a spontaneous state of mind. As such, there should be as little after-though and structure as possible while doing it. This is how it goes:

* Everyone gathers in a ring and one person holds a coat hanger.
* The person holding the coat hanger mimes an activity. The coat hanger may be used as an abstract prop if appropriate, or not at all.
* The others guess what the the person with the coat hanger is miming. As soon as someone guesses the right answer, the mime will hand over the coat hanger to the person who guessed the right answer,
* The person now holding the coat hanger now mimes another activity and the rest guess.
* The game goes on for about 10 minutes.

## Introductory text

Read the following introductory text aloud:

_Welcome to the larp Granny’s Great-granny’s Tiara!_

_The larp has six characters: Six generations of mothers and daughters from the same family. It takes place in the flat of Mother E. Mother E is an energetic self-employed in the catering business. The company is just barely carrying its costs. Her daughter F also lives here, who has not quite come of age yet._

_Once upon a time, when the Viscountess A arrived from Germany and married a nouveau-rich Swede, the family had large apartments, horses, wagons and servants. At that time, the women of the family had neither the need, nor the opportunity to work. As the generations have passed, the family’s circumstances have become simpler and simpler; from palaces to todays tiny flat. But the education and available options for the women have steadily grown. Daughter F will hopefully be the first women in her family to start at the University!_

_All that remains of the once glamorous life that the Viscountess lived is the family heirloom: The Tiara. All else is lost. The Tiara has passed from mother to daughter; the daughters have inherited it on their wedding day and the Tiara has stunned all who laid eyes on it. For some it specifically symbolises the wedding, the happiest(?) of all days. Others see the Tiara as a menace, a symbol of vanity and greed that keeps the women down. But it also symbolises the family history and the inherited bond between women, both symbolically and in a very tangible way. All the rest has been lost or has been inherited by the sons. Because Swedish tradition is that only jewellery is reliably inherited down through the line of women._

_Today Granny D is invited for afternoon tea. And the ghosts of Great-granny C, Granny’s Granny B, and Granny’s Great-granny the viscountess A herself have felt drawn to this small family this very day._

_The first three acts take place on day 1. Act 4 takes place in the dreams of the living characters later that night. Act 5 takes place during the following day, when Granny D comes back._

## Character handouts

Shuffle out the characters, or put some thought into it. If you have any experienced larpers, it can perhaps make sense to give them the ghost characters. Give everyone 10 minutes to read their character descriptions, at least twice.

## How ghost characters work

Read the following:

_Except for inside the dream sequences, the ghosts are, frustratingly enough, limited in their interaction with the living. They can whisper and try to influence, but it does not always work and it may also be misinterpreted. In general, they can also perform physical acts if these represent something non-physical. Examples: Put pressure on someones shoulders. Support someone. Beat a rhythm on someones chest to increase or decrease their heart-rate. The exception is eating and drinking which the ghosts can do freely at any time._

_The ghosts can also interact and speak freely with each other. They have complex relationships between themselves and very much enjoy commenting how both the living and the dead react to situations._

_In this larp silence is important. Very important. The living characters must include silence as a natural part of their way of interacting with each other. Otherwise the ghosts will have a hard time getting heard. Before you say something, feel free to take a long and deep breath._

## Optional preparation
Play the following test scene to get a feeling for how ghosts can work on a larp. Let two of the living characters play maffia leaders who have challenged each other to Russian roulette. 

They each sit quietly in a chair, facing each other. They have a gun (Any item can substitute) containing one real shot and many empties. Each time they raise the gun to their head they can die. They send the gun back and forth and pull the trigger each time. 

The game ends when one of the characters decides that this time their luck ran out and they got a real bullet which kills them.

Each mafioso has two ghosts standing behind their back. They will try to influence the mafioso with whispers and light touches. One of the two is vengeful and hopes the mafioso dies. The other is loving and caring. 

As ghosts, experiment with how you can both raise the intensity of the situation or calm things down. After the scene, discuss what worked and what was difficult.

## Dream sequence

Read the following:

_Being a ghost is hard. But in the dream world, the ghosts have their time to shine. As a ghost, you can hold dream sequences with a living character who is asleep. In the dream sequence you can address the living directly and they can answer you back. You control the entire plot of the dream sequence._

_To hold a dream sequence you start by leading the dreamer into the middle of the room and then placing them where you want them. You then describe the environment you are in. You can also describe other characters who are present and may even use the other ghost players as extras. They can either play themselves or or someone else. You control the dream world completely, so everything you way will be true for the dreamer._

_Your goal with the dream sequence will be to make the dreamer understand something that is important to you. It is up to the dreamer to then interpret the dream afterwards as they see fit._

## Reread the characters
Let each player reread their character so they remember what it said.

## Speed-dating! 
Pair off all the players. Each pair then gets 60 seconds to have a quick talk. Do not reveal any big secrets at this time. Introduce your character in two sentences and say one sentence on how your character sees the character you are talking to. Both characters do not need to agree on the nature of the relationship. Then switch until everyone has talked to everyone else.

## Summarize of the acts
Read through the act descriptions in the chapter below.

# Game start!

# Act description

The larp is played as a sequence of shorter acts. Each act has a clear starting point, theme and a clear signal when it ends. Here follow a more extensive description of each act. 

## Act 1: Relationship building

20 minutes. Find the relations. Find your character.  Is ended by Mother E.

In this act the players shall become comfortable with their characters and their relationships. No significant development of the characters or their relationships shall happen in this act. It is OK to make small changes to how you view your character during this act. The goal is that you at the end of the act have a clear picture of who your character is and your starting relationships. This is also a time for the ghosts to calmly get the hang of how they can interact with each other and the living characters in a constructive way.

During this act, the characters will prepare the last of the food. Towards the end of the act all will take their seats around the table and start eating. Once everyone has started eating, Mother E will reveal that she intends to sell the Tiara. As soon as she has said this, and before anyone else can say anything, the act will end. Transition immediately to:

## Act 2: Monologues

5-10 minutes: What does your character really feel? Started by Mother E and ended when all have spoken.

This mini-act starts directly after Mother E has informed the others that she plans to sell the Tiara. One at the time, in any order, the players let their characters have an internal monologue about how they feel at this exact moment about the decision. An internal monologue means that the player lets their character speak completely from the heart, as if no-one was listening. No other characters are allowed to comment or react to what is said. Once everyone is done, there is a short pause in silence where any who may have gotten up are given time to sit down. Then begins:

## Act 3: Conflict 

About 20 min: Make the conflict lines between characters clear. Started by Mother E and ended by Granny D.

In this act, each character pushes their agenda and listens to the opinions of others. It is OK for your character to nuance their view on any given topic, but any disagreements shall not be resolved in this act. 

The act begins with a jump back in time. Mother E once more announces that she has decided to sell the Tiara. After this, all characters are free to act as they wish. However, no-one may leave the table until each character, ghosts included, have had the chance to speak up. 

After about 23 minutes, Granny D’s booked taxi will call and announce that they are waiting. At this time, Granny D will say good bye and leave the apartment ending the act. Both Daughter F and Mother E can also end the act early by leaving the apartment. 

## Act 4: Dream sequence

10-30 minutes. Takes place during the night between day one and day two. In this act, and this act only, the ghosts are completely free to do whatever they want. Started by Great-granny C and ended by Viscountess A.	

This act has three short scenes, one per ghost. Ahead of each scene, the responsible ghost player gets a minute to gather their thoughts and talk to any extras they wish to recruit. They then lead their assigned living character to the center of the room, explain the premise of the scene and start it.

## Act 5: Resolution / The Day After
20 minutes. Granny D is invited back. Started by Daughter F and ended by Mother E.

The last act takes place the day after. All, both living and dead, have gathered for a mid-morning tea/coffee break (Swedish Fika). During this act, the characters try to find a resolution in their relations with the other living and dead characters. This resolution can be either negative (Meaning the characters agree to disagree) or positive (Meaning the characters find common ground and understanding). The scene, and the game, ends with Mother E being called up by the auction house and informing them about her final decision regarding the Tiara. During this phone call, all other characters must listen in silence. When Mother E hangs up, the game has ended. Alternatively, the auction firm calls Mother E and asks for a decision.

When act 5 has ended, leave a few minutes for free reflections and reactions from all players to the game. Then gather two-and-two, preferably with a player you have interacted less with during the game. Tell the other player how you experienced the game.

Then, gather everyone present in a circle, and allow each player to tell the larger group about their thoughts and their experience. It is encouraged to comment our fun and interesting things other players did during the game that improved your experience. Respect the speaker by only asking short clarification questions and not starting any discussions until everyone has had their turn.

# Characters

## Daughter F
You were born in 1995 in a rental apartment in Vasastan in downtown Stockholm and you are now 17 years old. Your father left your family when you were seven to move back to Australia and you not forgiven him for this. 

You do not have any particular interest in your fathers family but you do feel a strong connection to your ancestresses and their fantastic history. You are fascinated by history and want to study history or archeology at university.

At some point in the future, when you get married, you will inherit the Tiara as the next in line of your family. It came to Seden with your great-granny’s granny, a german noblewoman. As a school project, you have done some research into the women of family five generations back. Your ancestress, the Viscountess of Holstein-Kiel, whose entire family was killed by a mob during the revolution of 1848, fled all by herself through Europe and had many adventures in both Paris and Milano. She finally arrived in Stockholm where a rich industry magnate fell head over heals for her and they had a magnificent fairytale wedding — with the Tiara glittering on the head of the Viscountess. The Tiara is an important symbol of your background and your identity.

You want a song connection back to your ancestresses and the strongest is the idea that you will once get married wearing the family Tiara.

### Player instructions

You start act 5 ( Resolution / The day after ) after all have sat down at the table. When everything seems to be in order, you start the act by simply saying anything that comes to your characters mind. 

Feel free to improvise anecdotes about past events you have uncovered when studying your family history, as well as adventures the Viscountess had while traveling Europe. Escaped in a hay wagon! Was rescued by the crown prince, later emperor, Franz Joseph of Austria who fell in love with her and would have given up his throne for her, had she only wanted him to! Elaborate away as they are all rumours or  notes you have found in old diaries. 

### Voluntary accessory
A book. Preferably an old classic.

## Mother E

You were born in a simple apartment in southern downtown Stockholm, in 1959 and you are 53 years old. You have a practical mind and like getting things done. After high-school, you started a catering business that you have run since then. It has slowly grown, and you now have a solid network of chefs and can take on rather large events. Unfortunately, profitability is a bit of a challenge meaning you make ends meet, but not a lot more. The job also means long hours and late evenings, but you are proud of what you have achieved. Your only concern is that you have not been able to give your daughter the financial security you would have wanted.

Your were married for a few years to your daughters father, a charming bartender from Australia, before you split up and he moved back to his family farm in Australia. You do not actively dislike each other, but you have very little contact. Your daughter has not wanted to meet him after he left, and it has simply not happened.

There are two things you would like to do for your daughter. One is to travel a month or two to Australia so that she can reconnect with her Australian heritage. The other is that you would like to give her enough money for a downpayment on an apartment when se is to go out in the world in a few years. These are things you have heard that other parents do for their kids but which have not been possible for you. 

But, when you got married, you inherited the fantastic family heirloom, the Tiara. The idea is that your daughter will get is when she is married, a somewhat stale family tradition. You have thought about this for many years and have now made up your mind. You will sell the Tiara. It has been valued to 150 000 SEK which would cover both a trip to Australia and a small fund for your daughter.

The auction firm will call you tomorrow to arrange the details. Before then, you want to inform your daughter and your mother about the decision. You are unsure what sort of reaction you will get, but deep down you know this to be the right decision so it is important for you that they understand why you are doing this.

### Player instructions

#### Act 1 

You will finish act 1 by saying, after about 20 minutes, “I have decided to sell the Tiara”.

Other characters will catch their breath and want to speak, but they may not. Raise a fist above your head and say “Freeze. We now go in to act 2. We shall now, one by one, have a short monologue about what our characters feel.”

Then do a monologue, no longer than 60 seconds about your own thoughts on the matter. Then nod to another player who can take over. When all have had their turn, raise your hand again and say “Act 3, conflict, starts now and continues for 20 minutes.”

Lower your hand and repeat your last line: “I have decided to sell the Tiara”

### Voluntary accessory

A cell phone that rings occasionally. You do not answer except at the end of act 5.

## Granny D

You were born in 1925 in a middle class apartment in Stockholm and you are 87 years old. You grew up in the shadow of a principled matriarch of a mother and never demanded much space, which was fine for you. You want people to agree and like each other, and dislike conflict of any kind.

Only once in your life did you ever stand up to your mother and that was the day you applied to go to teachers collage and start your won career. Your grandmother B, in whose large country house you spend many fantastic summers, helped you finance your studies. You became a teacher and later married a colleague from the school in Söder, in downtown Stockholm, where you worked. You are therefore the first woman of your family with her own professional income.

Regarding the Tiara, you don’t really have a strong relationship with it. You wore it when you got married, but what will you do with a diamond sparkling piece of jewellery?  You do, however, know how much it meant to your mother.

In your life, what matters most is the happiness of your daughter E and your granddaughter F.

Your secret wish is to free yourself from your mother, whose opinions and (non-)approval have always loomed over you. 

### Player instructions

You will finish act 3, conflict. It is the act that starts with Mother E repeating her line “I have decided to sell the Tiara”. End the act by pretending to receive a message/call on your old cell phone saying your booked taxi has arrived. You end the act by saying good by and leaving the apartment. Wait a second and then walk back into the room with your fist raised above your head and saying “This ends act 2. Act 3 consists of 3 dream sequences. We move away the table and chairs to get an open space and then we give the scene to Granny’s Granny C”.

### Voluntary Accessory
A pastille box to offer when brokering peace.

## Granny’s Granny C

You were born in 1894 in Gnesta, a small village in the countryside outside Stockholm. You grew up comfortably but simply with the smell of freshly baked cinnamon rolls, but you know your family history. 

You are the descendent of a fantastic family history, filled with adventure and glamour. Never was this more clear that in the live of your grandmother, the Viscountess A, whom you always looked up to. Losing here when you were just a teenager was a hard blow. A while later, most of the country house was lost ti a fire, destroying almost everything that linked back to your family history and financial security. The only remnant was the Tiara, which you inherited when you got married. The Tiara was your most prized possession and your connection with your ancestresses. You have never even considered the idea that it could ever be sold.

You married a bank clerk when you were young and moved back to downtown Stockholm with him, fleeing the suffocating country life. There you ruled the household with an iron fist valuing a conservative, but active, lifestyle. You participated in several causes taking care of the moral of society. You had arrange meetings and sewing bees in your apartment, and conducted cultural outings to the theatre. You did not care much for the fight for the right to vote, which was in full swing during your teenage years. You have tried to lead your daughter with a firm grip and make her understand the value of the old housewife ideal, and the feminine heritage and duty. If women try to be like men, they lose their feminine power and greatness. You try to balance your disappointment with your daughter for going against you when she went to teachers collage with a secret admiration (So far never spoken out loud) that she actually did it…

You do not want your descendants to lose their link back to their ancestresses and the Tiara is the foremost and last symbol that remains.

Despite your differences, you have a mostly positive relationship with your mother B, But you do think that her decision to go around you and financially support your daughters collage tuition was equal parts helping her and sticking it to you.

You never understood your mother B’s bitterness to her mother, the Viscountess A, and the fantastic life that A gave her. You sometimes get angry with B that she does not appreciate A.

You will not tell anyone about your grief connected to the house fire, and what truly happened there, until you hold a dream sequence with Mother E in act 3 where you will visualise/tell exactly what happened and how you felt about it. During the dream sequence you will communicate how important you consider continuity and family to be and how disappointed you would be if she were to get rid of the last family heirloom.

### Player instructions

You start act 4 (Dream Sequence) when Granny D, with her fist raised above her head, tells you to do this. You will have the first dream sequence together with Mother E. It may take between 2 and 10 minutes. Bring her to the middle of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story.

You control the game world completely and everything you say becomes reality. Borrow other players as extras if you wish, but you will not have time to give them particularly detailed instructions. 

End the scene by saying “I now leave your dream. Come with me” and take Mother by the hand to the edge of the room. 

### Voluntary Accessory.

A fine broach

## Granny’s Granny B

You were born in a grand apartment in central Stockholm in 1860. You grew up surrounded by nannies, governesses and girl schools. What you lacked in your childhood, was a mother who was present.  You thought that no matter how hard you tried to get close to her, you never succeeded. Your clearest memory of her, the Viscountess A, was from when se was sitting at her dressing table getting ready to go out to yet another party. Next to her was always the great Tiara, the last remnant of her upbringing in the German nobility. As such, it always represented everything wrong with your childhood.

As an adult you found a good man, the postmaster of Gnesta, and you moved as far from the city as you could. There you raised your daughter with baking and crafts and all the love you never got. But she was a stubborn one and it was clear from an early age that she idolised her grandmother, the Viscountess and the fast life in the city. As soon as she was grown, she married a city man and moved back to that life.

Your beloved granddaughter, D, was with you most summers and when your daughter was not prepared to help out financially, you pitched in and gave D the money for tuition for teachers collage. 

You do not think your mother could have missed how disappointed you were with her, but even so she has never apologised; she was always too self-centred. But even so, you feel a respect for her deep down, for a reason you have never told anyone, living or dead. 

Regarding the Tiara, you think it might as well be sold off and the money used for something useful. It is a bad symbol of decadence. You inherited it when you got married, but then let it rest in the bank vault and never touched it. Today, you regret not selling it yourself when you had the chance but followed the family tradition and handed it to your daughter on her wedding day.

You will play passively aggressive and not speak plainly about how you feel about your mother until you have a dream sequence with your granddaughter D in Act 4. There you will tell her in detail what sort of person Great-Granny's granny the Viscountess A really is!

## Player instructions

In act 4 (The Dream Sequence) you will have the second dream sequence together with your grand-daughter, Granny D. It may take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes. Bring her to the center of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story.

You control the game world completely and everything you say becomes reality. Borrow other players as extras if you wish, but you will not have time to give them particularly detailed instructions. 

End the scene by saying “I now leave your dream. Come with me” and take Granny D by the hand to the edge of the room. 

### Voluntary accessory

A kitchen implement.

## Granny's Great-granny , Viscountess A

You were born into a poor farmer’s family in Småland in 1833. You always had an appetite for the good things in life. When your brother got the opportunity to go down to the shipyard in Lübeck in Germany and work there, you followed him to get a chance to see the world.

Once in Lübeck, you managed to get a job in the kitchen of a lesser noble family, which was not quite the glamour you were looking for. With some charm and one or two less than noble acts, you managed to rise to the position of chambermaid which was somewhat more to your taste. 

Because of local unrest, the family you worked for with had do depart to America on short notice. You stayed behind to pack up the last of the possessions, which you also did. But rather than accompany the luggage across the ocean, you put a substantial amount of money, some jewels and a fantastic Tiara in your pocket and disappeared. 

Back in Stockholm, you introduced yourself under a new noble-sounding name. With the money you had, and the Tiara more specifically, you were quickly accepted into society. Everyone in Stockholm, including your children and grand-children, think you are a Viscountess from Holstein-Kiel whose entire family was murdered by the mob in the revolution of 1848. It is said that you fled through many adventures in both Paris and Milano before you finally arrived in Stockholm and settled there. 

An industrial magnate of humble origins but with with an unbelievable income fell for you and soon you had the life you always dreamed of. Parties, social functions and no more scrubbing of floors. 

Together you had a daughter and a son, and you made sure that they were given a first-rate upbringing with nannies and good schools, all things you could not even dream of as a child. You know that your daughter is angry with you for being what she considers an absent mother, but she cannot even imagine how good she had it. Your motto has always been "Carpe Diem" and you are a bit sad that your daughter did not adopt the same perspective on life. Your grand-daughter, however, showed more grit but unfortunately you did not live long enough to see her grow up into a woman. 

With regards to the Tiara, it was a practical item and a means to achieve your dreams, but you have always been a pragmatic person and sometimes find that your descendents have shown just a bit too much sentimentality and focus a bit too much on family history rather than getting to where they want in life. 

You will not tell anyone your true story or how you came by the Tiara until you are doing your dream sequence with your great great grand-daughter F, where you will show/tell in monologue form the entire story with all of the details. 

### Player instructions

In act 4 (The Dream Sequences) you will have the third and last dream sequence together with Daughter F. It may take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes. Bring her to the center of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story.

You control the game world completely and everything you say becomes reality. Borrow other players as extras if you wish, but you will not have time to give them particularly detailed instructions. 

End the scene by saying “I now leave your dream. Come with me” and take Daughter F by the hand to the edge of the room. As it is the last of the dream sequences, once it is over, raise a fist above your hand and say "Now we move on to Act 5: The day after. We put back the table and chairs and start the scene as soon as Daughter F begins to act."

### Voluntary Accessory

An envelope symbolising an important letter you never actually wrote. Perhaps a letter to your parents, or maybe your big brother?
