<h2 id="aboutthegame">About the game</h2>

<p>Granny’s Great Grandma’s Tiara is a low-key nordic larp about Swedish femininity, traditionally female concerns and the relationships between mothers and daughters. It involves six generations of women from the same family, three living and three dead, deciding the fate of their greatest family heirloom. The larp takes place in Stockholm in the year 2020.</p>

<p>A single production of the larp takes about 3.5 hours, including preparation and post-larp reflections. It requires exactly six players and an optional game master and works well for beginners. In a pinch, it can also be played by 5 players with the game master taking the role of Great Grandmother D.</p>

<p>This larp makes use of the ghost meta technique in a very literal sense. The ghosts of the three dead generations have both personalities and agendas. They will make use of any and all influences they have have on their descendents to achieve their goals.</p>

<h3>Basic larp concepts</h3>

<p>If you are new to larping, here are a few concepts and terms you need to know.</p>

<h4>Nordic Larp</h4>

<p>Larp refers to a type of interactive game or storytelling in which the players assume a role and act as a character within the set fiction. It can be described as theatre without an audience or script. What sets the Nordic larp traditions apart from others is a strong emphasis on collaboration and collective creation, unobtrusive rules, [...] sometimes including heavy themes. See <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Nordic_larp">https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Nordic_larp</a></p>

<h4>Character</h4>

<p>The in-story characters that you play. These are the six generations of women.</p>

<h4>Player</h4>

<p>The real-world person paying one of the characters.</p>

<h4>Game Master</h4>

<p>A game master is the person running the game. It is sometimes synonymous with Organizer. See <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Game_Master">https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Game_Master</a></p>

<h4>Ghosts</h4>

<p>A ghost character is traditionally a character that does not represent a real physical being. They have traditionally been used by game masters as tools to interact with the subconsciousness of the player characters. In this game, however, the ghosts represent actual dead people.</p>

<h4>Raised fist / Cut</h4>

<p>If a participant raises their fist and/or calls out "CUT", you immediately stop where you are and fall silent. Either the person will provide a direct instruction to you, the player, which you must follow. Or something serious has gone wrong and the game must take a break until the serious issue has been resolved.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate to call CUT if the game has to stop for a short period to sort something out; for example an accident where a player got hurt. Safety first.</p>

<h4>Brems</h4>

<p>Brems is Norwegian for "break" and is used as a code word to tell another player to dial things back a bit, but otherwise continue the game. Many Nordic larps, including this one, deal with intense emotions and things can get heated. There is no shame in using the "Brems" word. Trust that your fellow players will back down if you tell them to, but also trust that they will tell you if you go too far: you don't need to hold back.</p>

<h3>Swedish cultural and geographical context</h3>

<p>For players unfamiliar with some of the locations or cultural contexts mentioned below, here is a quick summary of local concepts relevant to this game. These concepts have counterparts in very many cultures, so they should be easily repleacable with your local equivalents. As Swedish culture is not particularly sensitive to the issues of cultural appropriation, feel free to mix and match as it suits you.</p>

<h4 id="sweden">Sweden</h4>

<p>Up until the end of the first world war, Sweden was an extremely poor country. Life for the majority consisted of small family farms on rented land, hard labour, and starvation. In contrast, the rich lived luxurious lives.</p>

<p>Unlike the poor pre-war times, Sweden of today is prosperous and has a significant public safety net. This means that all people are guaranteed free university eduction, free healthcare, and a basic retirement plan. But an apartment in Stockholm is very costly and a hurdle for a young person wanting to set up a life in the city.</p>

<h4>Vasastan</h4>

<p>Vasastan is a part of northern downtown Stockholm. It has been a decidedly middle-class area for a long time.</p>

<h4>Södermalm</h4>

<p>Södermalm is the southern half of downtown Stockholm. Up until a few decades ago, it was the poorer half of Stockholm. Recently, prices have rocketed, but due to rental control those who have lived there for a long time can still afford a reasonable apartment on a modest income.</p>

<h4>Gnesta</h4>

<p>Gnesta is a small town a full day's travel by horse and carriage from Stockholm (or 1h on commuter rail in modern times). It represents the southern edge of the greater Stockholm of today and the edge of civilisation from a downtown perspective.</p>

<h4>Germany</h4>

<p>For most of history before the second world war, Germany was a very rich country compared to the much poorer Sweden. Germany has been a go-to country for higher education and job opportunities except for the last two generations.</p>

<h4>Fika</h4>
<p>"Fika" is a tradition that is deeply engrained in Swedish culture. It is an informal social event consisting of sitting down and drinking a hot beverage and eating biscuits or sandwiches. It shares many similarities with the well-known Brittish afternoon tea, but can be held mid-morning, mid-afternoon or late evening and preferably at all of these times of day. Coffee is the traditional hot beverage served, but tea works as well.</p>
