<h3>Warmup</h3>

<p>When everyone has gathered and the preparations are done, do a warm-up to get the creative juices flowing. One suggestion is provided below:</p>

<h4>The Coat Hanger</h4>

<p>The point of this whimsical excercise is to get into a spontaneous and creative state of mind. So there should be as little after-thought and structure as possible to it. This is how it goes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone gathers in a ring and one person holds a coat hanger.</li>
<li>The person holding the coat hanger mimes an activity. The coat hanger may be used as an abstract prop if appropriate, or not at all. For example, the person can mime fishing with the hanger as a rod.</li>
<li>The others guess what the the person with the coat hanger is miming. As soon as someone guesses the right answer ("fishing!"), the mime will hand over the coat hanger to the person who guessed the right answer.</li>
<li>The new person to hold the coat hanger now mimes another activity and the remaining participants guess.</li>
<li>The game goes on for about 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introductory text</h3>

<p>Read the following introductory text aloud:</p>

<p class="quote">Welcome to the Granny’s Great Grandma’s Tiara!</p>

<p class="quote">This larp has six characters: six generations of mothers and daughters from the same family. It takes place in the small flat of Mother E. Mother E is an energetic self-employed entrepreneur within the catering business. The company keeps her busy, but just barely carries its costs. Her daughter F, who is 17 years old and almost a legal adult, also lives here.</p>

<p class="quote">Once upon a time, when the Viscountess A arrived from Germany and married a nouveau-rich Swede, the family had large apartments, horses, carriages and servants. At that time, the women of the family had neither the need nor the opportunity to work. As the generations have passed, the family's circumstances have become simpler and simpler; from Victorian palaces to today's tiny flat. But the level of education and work options for the women have grown steadily. Hopefully Daughter F will be the first woman in her family to go to University!</p>

<p class="quote">All that remains of the once glamorous life of the Viscountess is the family heirloom: The Tiara. All else has been lost. The Tiara has passed from mother to daughter: each generation has inherited it on their wedding day and the Tiara has stunned all who laid eyes on it. For some it specifically symbolises the wedding, the happiest(?) of all days. Others see the Tiara as a symbol of vanity and greed that keeps the women of the family down. But it also symbolises the family legacy and the inherited bond between women, both symbolically and in a very tangible way. All the rest has been lost or has been inherited by the sons. Because Swedish (historical) tradition declared that only jewelry is reliably inherited down through the line of women.</p>

<p class="quote">Today Granny D is invited for afternoon "fika". The ghosts of Great Grandma C, Granny’s Granny B, and Granny’s Great Grandma the Viscountess A herself have also found themselves drawn to this gathering of their descendents this very day...</p>

<p class="quote">The first three acts take place on the first day. Act 4 takes place in the dreams of the living characters later that same night. Act 5 takes place during the following day, when Granny D comes back for a mid-morning fika.</p>

<h3>Assigning Characters</h3>

<p>Shuffle out the characters, or put some thought into it. If you have any experienced larpers, it can perhaps make sense to give them the ghost characters. Give everyone 10 minutes to read their character descriptions at least twice. </p>

<p>In this text, the characters are refered to by their generation and a letter. Ask the players to give their character a name starting with their character's designation letter. As an example, Daughter F can be named Felicity by her player.</p>

<h3>How ghost characters work</h3>

<p>Read the following:</p>

<p class="quote">Outside the dream sequences the ghosts are, frustratingly enough, limited in their interaction with the living. They can whisper and try to influence, or even occasionally scream out loud, but the living do not always hear and often misinterpret. In general, ghosts can also perform physical acts if these represent something non-physical. Examples: Put pressure on someones shoulders. Support someone. Beat a rhythm on someones chest to increase or decrease their heart-rate. The exception is eating and drinking which the ghosts can do freely at any time.</p>

<p class="quote">The ghosts can also interact and speak freely with each other. They have complex relationships between themselves and very much enjoy commenting on the actions of both the living and the dead.</p>

<p class="quote">This is a larp where silence is important. Very important. The living characters must include silence as a natural part of the way they interact with each other. Otherwise the ghosts will have a hard time getting heard. Before you say anything, feel free to take a long and deep breath, in case any of the ghosts want to express themselves.</p>

<h3>Optional preparation</h3>
<p>Play the following test scene to get a feeling for how ghosts work.</p>

<p>Sit two players on chairs across from each other; these are the two characters in the scene. The remaining four players will play ghosts. Stand two of these ghost players behind each of the seated character players. Turn to the seated character players and read the following:</p>

<p class="quote">You are two old friends on vacation. You took a day-trip with a larger group to this small local sight, but you were late back to the pickup point. You now realize that your ride home has allready left and there are no obvious means of communication or transportation in sight. What to do?</p>

<p class="quote">You are free to take this story anywhere, but you as a player must never leave your chair until the end of the scene. The scene ends when one of you either decides to give the other a hug/handshake and resolve the situation together, or when one of you stands up and simply walks away.</p>

<p>Assign one ghost behind each seated character player as "Kindness" and the other as "Vengence". Read the following to them:</p>

<p class="quote">You are two parts of the personality of the seated character you stand behind. The first ghost is Kindness. You just want everyone to be helpful and nice to others. The second ghost is Vengance. You know that everything bad that happens to you is someone elses fault and that they must pay for it.</p>

<p class="quote">As ghosts, experiment with how you can alternate between raising the intensity of the situation and calming things down.</p> 

<p>Ask one of the seated character players to start the scene by saying "Where is the bus?". After the scene has ended, discuss what worked and what was difficult.</p>

<h3>Dream sequences</h3>

<p>Read the following:</p>

<p class="quote">Being a ghost is hard. But in the dream world, the ghosts are allowed to shine. As a ghost, you will be asked to take charge of a dream sequence with one specific living character who is asleep. In the dream sequence, you can talk directly to the living character and they can answer you back. As a ghost, you control the entire plot of the dream sequence.</p>

<p class="quote">To start a dream sequence you lead the dreamer into the middle of the room and then place them where you want them. You then describe the environment you both are in. You can also describe other characters who are present and may even use the other ghost players as extras. They can either play themselves or or someone else. You control the dream world completely, so everything you say will be true for the dreamer.</p>

<p class="quote">Your goal with the dream sequence will be to make the dreamer understand something that is important to you. It is up to the dreamer to then interpret the dream afterwards as they see fit.</p>

<h3>Reread the characters</h3>

<p>Let each player reread their character so they remember the details.</p>

<h3>Speed-dating!</h3>

<p>Pair off all the players. Each pair then gets 60 seconds to have a quick talk. Do not reveal any big secrets at this time. Introduce your character in two sentences and say one sentence about how you see the relationship between the two characters. Both characters do not need to agree on the nature of the relationship. Then switch until everyone has talked to everyone else.</p>

<h3>Summarise the acts</h3>

<p>Read through the act descriptions in the chapter below. If there is a game master, it is sufficient to read out the parts in bold to everyone.</p>

<h3>Game start!</h3>
