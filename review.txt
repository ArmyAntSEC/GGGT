Refer to the correct page number when instructing them to print out character descriptions and notes.

As an experienced larper, I assume the character names correspond with their generation. So Granny D is named so for her generation, but her real first name should also start with D (?) Is this correct? May need time to explain names and how the characters are to address each other.

Some international (American) players may be sensitive to gun violence, so you should consider including a content warning. My breakthrough larp was called "She's Got a Gun," but it's kind of frowned upon now even though it is a feminist design.... due to gun violence issues in real life.

How long should the debrief last?

Suggestion: mark each ghost character as such. (Great Granny D - GHOST) -- it's confusing at first who is a ghost and who is not
