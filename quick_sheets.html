                    <p>You start act 5 ( Resolution / The day after ) after all have sat down at the table. When everything seems to be in order, you start the act by simply saying anything that comes to your characters mind.</p>

                    <h2>Act 1: Relationship Building</h2>
                    <p>You will finish act 1 by saying, after about 20 minutes, “I have decided to sell the Tiara”. Other characters will probably catch their breath and want to speak, but they may not. Raise a fist above your head and say: “Cut". We now enter act 2. We shall now, one by one, hold a short monologue about our characters' feelings.”</p>
                    <h2>Act 2: Monologues</h2>
                    <p>Let your character hold a monologue, no longer than 60 seconds, about her thoughts on the matter of the Tiara. When you are done nod to another player who can take over. When all have had their turn and all are sitting down, raise your fist again and say: “Act 3, conflict, starts now and continues for 20 minutes”. Lower your fist and repeat your last line: “I have decided to sell the Tiara”</p>
                    <h2>Act 4: The Dream Sequences</h2>
                    <p>Act 4 ends with the Viscountess A telling everyone to put back the chairs and tables. While others do this, set an alarm on your cell phone so that it will ring 20 minutes after the start of act 5 (The day after / Resolution).</p>
                    <h2>Act 5: The Day After / Resolution</h2>
                    <p>Act 5 and the entire game will end when your cell phone rings. It is the auction house calling to get the final OK to sell the Tiara. Clearly tell them your decision. When the call is over, you will raise a fist above your head and say that the game is over.</p>

                    <p>You will finish act 3 (Conflict). This is the act that starts with Mother E repeating her line “I have decided to sell the Tiara”. End the act by pretending to receive a message/call on your old cell phone saying your booked taxi has arrived. You end the act by saying good by and leaving the apartment. Wait a second and then walk back into the room with your fist raised above your head, saying “This ends act 3. Act 4 consists of 3 dream sequences. We move away the table and chairs to get an open space and then we give the scene to Great-Grandmother C”.</p>

                    <p>You start act 4 (The dream sequences) when Granny D, with her fist raised above her head, tells you to do this. You will have the first dream sequence together with Mother E. It may take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes. Bring her to the middle of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story. Explain what really happened during the house fire and how it affected you. You control the game world completely and everything you say becomes reality. Borrow other Granny's players as extras if you wish, but you will not have time to give them particularly detailed instructions.</p>
                    <p>End the scene by saying “I now leave your dream. Come with me.” and take Mother by the hand to the edge of the room.</p>

Bring her to the center of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story.

Bring her to the center of the room. Explain how/where she “wakes up” in the dream. This is your chance to explain your perspective on the Tiara and its legacy. Tell your story. Tell your daughter the truth about who you really are. You control the game world completely and everything you say becomes reality.

                    <p>End the scene by saying “I now leave your dream. Come with me” and take Daughter F by the hand to the edge of the room. As it is the last of the dream sequences, once it is over, raise a fist above your hand and say "Now we move on to Act 5: The day after. We now put back the table and chairs and start the scene as soon as Daughter F begins to act."</p>
